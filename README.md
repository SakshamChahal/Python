# Python # 🩺 Safe Injection Practice – Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing global trends in **safe injection practices** to help prevent the transmission of diseases, raise health awareness, and support public health strategies.

## 📊 Project Objectives:
1. **Prevent transmission of diseases** such as HIV and Hepatitis through unsafe injections.
2. **Increase public health awareness** by identifying patterns and gaps in safe injection behavior.
3. **Analyze patient trends** to improve future treatment and healthcare policies.
4. **Support longevity** by promoting safer health behaviors and minimizing health risks.
5. **Gain analytical experience** in data visualization, statistics, and health data interpretation.

## 🧪 Key Features:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand distribution, trends, and outliers in safe injection data by country, age group, and year.
- **Statistical Testing:** Compare safe injection practices between age groups (`< 25` and `25+`) using **independent t-tests**.
- **Data Visualization:** Leverage Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize trends over time and across demographics.
- **Clean & Organized Code:** Well-commented, modular notebook suitable for extension and presentation.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy

## 📁 Dataset:
Data from **UNAIDS** reporting the percentage of individuals practicing safe injections, grouped by **country**, **year**, and **age subgroup**.

## ✅ Outcomes:
This analysis can help governments, health organizations, and NGOs make **data-driven decisions** to implement better awareness programs and improve healthcare outcomes globally.
